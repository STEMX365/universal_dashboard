# Universal Dashboard

**Universal Dashboard for Internet of Things, Satellite, and Ground Station**

### Overview
This project aims to create a universal dashboard that provides a comprehensive interface for managing and monitoring various systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, satellite data, and ground station operations. By centralizing the management of diverse technologies, this dashboard will streamline the monitoring and control of interconnected systems, promoting efficiency and ease of use.

### Features
- **Unified Interface**: The dashboard provides a single, cohesive interface for interacting with IoT devices, satellite data, and ground station operations, eliminating the need for separate, specialized interfaces.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Users can view real-time data and receive alerts from IoT devices, satellite feeds, and ground station activities, enabling proactive decision-making.
- **Customizable Widgets**: The dashboard supports customizable widgets and modules to display specific data and metrics relevant to each system, allowing for flexibility and tailored user experiences.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizing charts, graphs, and maps, the dashboard visualizes data from various sources to facilitate intuitive analysis and interpretation.
- **Control and Automation**: It offers control capabilities for managing IoT devices and ground station operations, along with automation features to streamline processes and workflows.

### Technologies
The dashboard is built using modern web technologies, including but not limited to:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript 
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Node.js, Express 
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets, MQTT, ActiveMQ
- **Visualization**: Three.JS, Chart.js
